      <p class="descrition">
        Swile ( lunchr ) is an application that simplifies the management of
        luncheon vouchers by companies. The company provides employees with a
        Mastercard connected to an application. Each month, the Lunchr account
        is funded by the company. However, at the moment, it is complicated to
        keep track of lunchr activities because the money provided by the
        company is not directly accessible and visible on the bank account.
        <br />
        For each activity, the user should be informed directly to allow him to
        manage his expenses. This will save time, he will be informed in real
        time of the status of his Lunchr account.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to control our spending, we could create an applet tha would
        send a text to the user according to his activities. For instance, when
        the user approaches 0 in his lunchr account, a text could warn him "
        Careful! You have only 20 euros left on your account". We could think of
        other scenarios such as sending a sms when the user spends more than a
        particular amount ( define the amount).
